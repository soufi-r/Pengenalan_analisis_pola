Abstract
Background: Understanding how food processing impacts type 2 diabetes (T2DM) control
is essential for disease management. This study aimed to assess the association between
ultra-processed food (UPF) consumption, as defined by the NOVA classification, and
metabolic parameters in T2DM patients. Methods: This was a cross-sectional analysis using
baseline data from the NUGLIC study, a multicenter randomized clinical trial. Multiple
linear and Poisson regressions were used to evaluate associations between quintiles of
processed and ultra-processed food consumption and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) as the
primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included fasting glucose, lipid profile, body mass
index (BMI), and waist circumference. Results: This study included 326 participants. UPF
consumption accounted for approximately 16.4% of total daily energy intake. No significant
linear associations were observed between higher consumption of industrialized foods
and anthropometric or glycemic markers. However, intermediate and high consumption
levels were associated with an increased total cholesterol (Q3: β= 26.6; Q4: β= 26.7) and
LDL-cholesterol (Q4: β= 19.8; Q5: β= 17.5). Conclusion: In T2DM patients, a higher intake
of processed and ultra-processed foods was linked to elevated cholesterol and LDL levels.
These findings highlight potential cardiovascular risks but do not support causality due to
the study’s cross-sectional design.

1. Introduction
The global increase in diabetes cases has become a major public health concern,
affecting 537 million adults worldwide in 2021, with 80% of them living in low- and
middle-income countries [ 1]. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) makes up more than 90%
of these cases, causing both large and small blood vessel complications, decreased life
expectancy, and a higher risk of heart disease, kidney problems, and cancer [ 2]. Despite
these challenges, it is believed that lifestyle changes like adopting a healthy diet, being

more physically active, and managing weight can help prevent or delay the onset of
T2DM [ 3–5]. Similarly, for those already diagnosed with T2DM, lifestyle adjustments are
crucial alongside medications and education about health, highlighting the importance of a
balanced diet in reaching treatment goals and reducing the risk of complications [6–8].
In recent years, the concept of diet quality has evolved to encompass more than just the
nutritional content of foods, extending to include the level of industrial processing involved
in their production [ 9]. Industrial formulations composed of refined food substances and
additives have given rise to a distinct food category known as ultra-processed foods (UPFs).
These products are typically ready-to-eat or semi-prepared items with a high energy density,
nutritional imbalance, and a lack of bioactive compounds [ 10]. UPF, along with three other
food categories, fresh and minimally processed foods, culinary ingredients, and processed
foods (PFs), are classified according to the extent and purpose of industrial processing in
the NOVA Food Classification proposed by Monteiro et al. [11].
The proportion of UPF in the diet can be viewed as a population-based metric of diet
quality [ 10], constituting up to 58% of daily energy intake and accounting for 89.7% of total
free sugar consumption for more than half of children and adults in developed countries.
Among individuals aged 40 to 69, followed for approximately 5 years, consumption of
UPF comprising about 22% of daily calories was associated with a 44% higher risk of
developing T2DM compared to those with lower daily consumption [ 12,13]. Further
evidence corroborates this finding and suggests that high UPF consumption is also linked
to an increased risk of abdominal obesity in adults and older individuals, as well as a
higher risk of hypertension in the same age group [ 14]. The elevated energy density of
these foods has been shown to contribute to excess daily energy intake, directly impacting
weight gain [ 15]. Moreover, the heightened level of processing is associated with higher
glycemic levels and reduced satiety [ 16], both important factors in the dietary management
of T2DM.
Despite the well-documented relationship between the consumption of UPF and
the risk of T2DM, there is currently a lack of evidence regarding the impact of this food
group on the treatment of the disease. This knowledge is also crucial for preventing
disease progression and reducing mortality in T2DM. It is already known that, in this
patient group, higher consumption of UPF, compared to lower consumption, has been
associated with a 64% and 155% higher risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality,
respectively [ 17]. Therefore, it is important to investigate the consumption of UPF and
understand its relationship with the metabolic control parameters of T2DM. Our hypothesis
is that individuals who primarily consume diets consisting of UPF may exhibit poorer
metabolic parameters. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess the association between
UPF consumption and metabolic control in patients with T2DM.
2. Methods
2.1. Design and Ethical Aspects
This secondary cross-sectional analysis utilized baseline data from a multicenter
study entitled ‘Nutritional Strategy for Glycemic Control in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes
Mellitus: NUGLIC Study’ [ 18], conducted by the Hcor Research Institute in collaboration
with the Brazilian Ministry of Health through the Development Support Program for the
Unified Health System—PROADI-SUS.
The NUGLIC study [ 18] is registered on the ClinicalTrials.gov website under the
registration identifier NCT03793855. This is an interventional study, with an actual start
date of 6 May 2019, primary completion date of 28 September 2021, and study completion
date of 30 December 2022. A total of 370 participants were enrolled [ 18]. This study
received approval from the Research Ethics Committees from the Federal University of
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2025 ,22, 1275 3 of 13
Health Sciences of Porto Alegre (UFCSPA) and Irmandade da Santa Casa de Misericordia
de Porto Alegre (ISCMPA) and is registered under the number CAEE 97000618.3.2007.5335.
All participants voluntarily provided written informed consent to participate in this
study, in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. This study involved minimal risk and
followed both national and international guidelines for research involving human subjects.
This study adhered to the STROBE Statement Checklist for Cross-Sectional Studies [19].
2.2. Participants
This study included individuals diagnosed with T2DM, aged 30 years or older, with
glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) levels of ≥7%, who had not received nutritional guidance for
at least 6 months. Recruitment occurred among outpatients at six specialized endocrinology
and nutrition referral services in the southern, southeastern, and northeastern regions of
Brazil. Exclusion criteria comprised individuals with (a) type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM),
latent adult autoimmune diabetes (LADA), or HbA1c ≥12%; (b) severe neuropathy;
(c) chronic kidney disease; (d) a diagnosis of cancer or a life expectancy less than six months;
(e) chemical dependency/alcoholism or the use of antipsychotics; (f) autoimmune disease
or chronic steroid use; (g) gastroparesis; (h) pregnancy, lactation, or gestational DM; (i) an
episode of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) within the past 60 days; (j) wheelchair use;
(k) extreme obesity (body mass index [BMI] ≥40 kg/m2); (l) cognitive, neurological, or
psychiatric conditions preventing participation in the study; and (m) involvement in other
clinical intervention studies.
2.3. Measurements
The evaluation of patients followed a standardized protocol administered by appro-
priately trained and qualified researchers. Data were collected between the years 2019 and
2020. All patients underwent data collection related to anthropometric and biochemical
indicators. Dietary consumption data, as well as sociodemographic and behavioral infor-
mation such as gender, were also gathered, age (in years), race/ethnicity (white, black,
yellow, mixed-race, or indigenous), marital status (single, married, divorced, in a stable
union, or widowed), education level (illiterate and incomplete elementary school, incom-
plete elementary I and II, incomplete elementary school II and incomplete high school,
complete high school and incomplete college education, or complete college education),
pre-existing conditions (systemic arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia, acute myocardial
infarction, and/or retinopathy), current medications, and smoking status (yes or no) were
obtained through self-reports.
The assessment of anthropometric indicators was conducted by measuring weight
(kg) and height (m) and waist circumference (WC) (cm), with the latter measured in
duplicate, and the average value used for analysis. Weight and height were measured using
appropriate attire, without accessories or shoes. These data were subsequently utilized for
calculating Body Mass Index (BMI) (kg/m2). WC was measured at the midpoint between
the lower edge of the ribcage and the iliac crest on the mid-axillary line [20,21].
The biochemical assessment included the analysis of total cholesterol (TC) (mg/dL),
HDL-cholesterol (HDL-c) (mg/dL), LDL-cholesterol (LDL-c) (mg/dL), fasting triglycerides
(TG) (mg/dL), fasting glucose (FG) (mg/dL), and HbA1c (%). This analysis was performed
in reference laboratories of participating centers, using appropriate analytical techniques.
Altered laboratory parameters were considered [ 22,23], with values: TC > 200 mg/dL,
HDL-c < 40 mg/dL, LDL-c ≥100 mg/dL, TG ≥150 mg/dL, FG ≥130 mg/dL, and
HbA1c ≥7.0%.

2.4. Exposure
The exposure variable was the consumption of processed foods, achieved by grouping
the categories of PF and UPF. This grouping was necessary due to the relatively low
consumption of ultra-processed foods observed in this sample. This consumption was
measured as a percentage of total energy intake (%TEI) and categorized into quintiles.
Dietary intake was assessed through 24 h dietary recalls (R24h) at two different time
points on random days: during the initial interview and seven days later through telephone
calls. The estimation of macronutrients and micronutrients from each R24h was calculated
using Vivanda®software, allowing for the standardization of consumed food items.
The NOVA Food Classification [ 10,11] was utilized to categorize consumed foods into
four processing groups: (1) fresh and minimally processed foods, (2) culinary ingredients,
(3) PF, and (4) UPF. This classification system facilitates the grouping of foods based on
the level and type of industrial processing they undergo, taking into account all physical,
biological, and chemical methods employed, as well as the addition of synthetic additives
for commercial purposes, and their impact on the food matrix and nutrient synergy [ 10,24].
Subsequently, the average energy intake for each NOVA group was calculated for each
individual based on the two R24h collected. The resulting average energy intake for each
group was then converted into a percentage of the TEI.
2.5. Outcome
Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (%) was used as the primary outcome measure, while
the metabolic parameters total cholesterol (TC) (mg/dL), high-density lipoprotein choles-
terol (HDL-c) (mg/dL), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) (mg/dL), triglycerides
(TG) (mg/dL), fasting glucose (FG) (mg/dL), and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (%), as
well as Body Mass Index (BMI) (kg/m2) [20] and waist circumference (WC), were utilized
as secondary outcome measures and treated as continuous variables. Obesity was de-
fined as a categorical variable when the BMI was ≥30 kg/m2and it was also treated as a
secondary outcome.
2.6. Statistical Analysis
The sample size was calculated expecting a Cohen’s effect size of f = 0.20, suggested
as a good initial estimate to obtain a non-negligible result of the difference in HB1AC
between UPF quintiles with a significance of 5% and a power of 80% [ 25], resulting in
305 participants.
The analyses were conducted using the statistical software SPSS Version 25.0, consid-
ering results significant at p< 0.05. To assess the distribution of health, sociodemographic,
anthropometric, dietary consumption, and behavioral characteristics of the sample, qual-
itative variables were presented as absolute and relative frequencies, while quantitative
variables were reported as mean and standard deviation or the median and interquartile
range (IQR). Normality was assessed using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test.
The consumption of PF and UPF was combined into a single category and divided
into quintiles. Differences between quintiles were assessed using chi-square tests with
adjusted standardized residuals and the Kruskal–Wallis test with Bonferroni correction for
multiple comparisons.
The impact of food consumption quintiles on categorical outcomes (obesity) was
assessed using Poisson regression analysis, while multiple linear regression analysis was
employed for all other outcomes, with adjustment for robust variance. All models were
adjusted for age, race, sex, income, education, current medication, level of physical activity,
and smoking status. Estimates of regression coefficients and odds ratios (OR) with 95%
confidence intervals (CI) were presented.

3. Results
Sociodemographic, clinical, and therapeutic characteristics are outlined in Table 1.
Out of the 370 participants initially included in the NUGLIC study [ 18], 44 were excluded
from this analysis due to missing data on food consumption, exclusively resulting from
their persistent unavailability for telephone contact during the COVID-19 pandemic. There
were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between excluded and included
participants; therefore, this exclusion is unlikely to have introduced relevant selection bias.

The final sample consisted of 326 participants, with 60% female, 63.1% married or in a
stable relationship, 49.2% white, and 15% active smokers. The most prevalent comorbidities
were hypertension (82.5%) and dyslipidemia (63.1%), while the most commonly used
medications were biguanides (86.5%) and insulin (43.4%).
Table 2 presents the data from laboratory tests, anthropometric measurements, and
dietary intake. The mean BMI was 30.3 ±4.6 kg/m2, and WC was 103.1 ±11.7 cm.
Laboratory tests indicated a mean FG of 166.5 ±59.3 mg/dL and HbA1c of 8.7 ±1.5%.
The mean daily energy intake was 1515.50 ±598.74 kilocalories (kcal), with the highest
dietary consumption represented by fresh or minimally processed foods (median of 64.4;
IQR 54.1–73.5), while culinary ingredients reached a median of 1.8 (0–5.3). No extreme
daily energy intake (<500 kcal/day or >6000 kcal/day) [ 26,27] was observed, which would
necessitate excluding the data. The dietary consumption profile by processing group in
each of the PF + UPF quintiles can be visualized in Table 3. From quintiles 1 to 5, while the
consumption of fresh and minimally processed foods decreases, the consumption of PF
and UPF increases, all following a linear trend. The consumption of culinary ingredients
did not show the same trend. Even in the highest quintile of PF + UPF consumption,
the median consumption of fresh and minimally processed foods (45.2; IQR 38.9–48.8)
remained substantially higher than the median consumption of UPF (26.2; IQR 16.8–39.1).

In the multiple linear regression analysis, PF + UPF consumption in quintiles 3, 4, and
5 had a similar impact on TC and LDL-c levels across these quintiles, with some imprecision
in the estimates. In quintiles 3 (Q3) and 4 (Q4) (Q3: 27.92–36.86% of TEI; Q4: 36.87–45.55%
of TEI), the consumption of these foods was associated with the greatest observed increase
in TC levels (Q3: 26.6 mg/dL; 95% CI 10.7–42.6; Q4: 26.7 mg/dL; 95% CI 10.69–42.69),
compared to the consumption of individuals in the lowest quintile (Q1 ≤19.54% of TEI).
Regarding the LDL-c fraction, the greatest impact of PF + UPF consumption was observed
in Q4, being associated with an increase of 19.8 mg/dL (95% CI 6.93–32.67), compared to
the reference category. However, the increases in TC and LDL-c levels did not follow a
consistent linear trend across the quintiles of PF + UPF consumption (Table 4).

4. Discussion
In this study , we investigated the association of dietary intake, categorized according to
the NOVA Food Classification, with the glycemic, lipid profile, and anthropometric data of
patients with T2DM. Our findings revealed a predominant consumption of fresh or minimally
processed foods, which accounted for 64% of the total daily energy intake. PF and UPF, as
assessed by R24h, had a median consumption of 12.5% and 16.4% of TEI, respectively. We
analyzed outcomes related to glycemic and lipid profiles, BMI, and WC across each quintile
of PF and UPF consumption. However, only TC and LDL-c demonstrated an association with
the highest quintiles of consumption (Q3, Q4, and Q5). For HDL-c, an isolated association
was observed with the quintile of highest consumption (Q5).
The biological plausibility for foods to be associated with certain outcomes and not
others in individuals with T2DM can be explained by a series of factors. These range from
the nutritional composition of UPF, which, being rich in sugars, saturated and trans fats,
sodium, and food additives, can directly affect the body’s metabolic response, influencing
blood glucose levels and insulin sensitivity [ 28]. Additionally, their high glycemic index
can lead to glucose spikes and subsequent insulin resistance in susceptible individuals, con-
tributing to the development of type 2 diabetes and other adverse metabolic outcomes [ 29].
UPF can also promote chronic low-grade inflammation and oxidative stress in the body
due to the presence of pro-inflammatory ingredients. Although these inflammatory and
oxidative processes are implicated in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)
and its related complications [ 30], we did not observe an association in our sample between
the intake of processed and ultra-processed foods (PF + UPF) and elevated glycemic levels.
It is possible that applying the R24 only twice, as well as the change in data collection

method (from in-person to telephone interviews), may have affected the assessment of in-
take. Moreover, we cannot rule out that the COVID-19 pandemic may have led individuals
to eat more meals at home, which could have influenced their dietary patterns [ 31] and
possibly the glycemic levels observed in this sample.
The association between UPF and adverse outcomes in T2DM is multifaceted and
involves a complex interaction between nutritional composition, glycemic index, inflamma-
tory response, and oxidative stress. Individuals with T2DM, including those at increased
risk of developing it, are particularly susceptible to the deleterious effects of these foods
due to their specific pathophysiological characteristics [ 17]. Therefore, despite our findings,
we consider that reducing the intake of UPF may be an important strategy in the prevention
and management of T2DM and its associated complications.
In our sample, the median consumption of UPF was 16.4% of the TEI, which aligns
with findings from other studies involving the Brazilian population in various settings.
A cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from the ELSA-Brasil study (2008–2010) [ 32]
reported mean UPF consumption values of 22.7% in a sample of adults. Similarly, a study
by Canhada et al. [ 33] also conducted with participants from the ELSA study, reported a
value of 24.6% for UPF consumption.
The relationship between UPF consumption and overweight and obesity has been
described in studies involving different populations [ 32–34]. Indeed, UPF has a higher
caloric content and when consumed excessively and/or within an unbalanced diet, they
contribute to weight gain. Evidence suggests that high UPF consumption is associated
with higher BMI and increased prevalence of overweight or obesity [ 35,36]. A cohort
study involving 8451 Spanish adult university students reported that participants with
the highest UPF consumption (Q4) had a higher risk of developing overweight or obesity
(adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.26; 95% CI: 1.10–1.45; p= 0.001) compared to those in the
lowest consumption quartile [ 34]. A similar finding was observed in a cross-sectional
study [ 32], where the fourth quartile (>30.8%) versus the first quartile (<17.8%) of UPF
consumption was associated with a 27% and 33% higher risk of weight gain and waist
circumference, respectively. Similarly, those in the fourth quartile of consumption had a
20% higher risk of incident overweight/obesity and a 2% higher risk of incident obesity [ 32].
In our sample, there was no association between BMI or WC and the quintiles of higher
PF + UPF consumption; however, unlike our data, the reported studies conducted dietary
intake analysis through food frequency questionnaires.
The management of glycemic control in patients with T2DM is a cornerstone of non-
pharmacological care as emphasized by guidelines [ 37]. Given that diet plays a protective
role and is integral to the treatment for individuals with T2DM, appropriate nutrition
focuses on a balanced consumption of whole foods, fiber, fruits, and vegetables. However,
there is growing evidence indicating that the consumption of UPF is associated with various
negative outcomes, including T2DM [ 13,38,39]. A systematic review with meta-analysis
involving 415,554 participants (including 21,932 cases of T2DM) suggested that each 10%
increase in UPF consumption was associated with a 12% higher risk (95% CI 10–13%) of
developing T2DM [38].
The same study, utilizing data from three other large studies (the Nurses’ Health
Study, Nurses’ Health Study II, and Health Professional Follow-Up Study), investigated
the incidence of T2DM in relation to the consumption of UPF. Dietary intake was assessed
using food frequency questionnaires, and UPF were categorized according to the NOVA
Food Classification. The extreme quintiles of UPF intake demonstrated a HR of 1.56 (95%
CI 1.47–1.65; p< 0.0001) for T2DM. Additionally, each increase of one serving per day was
associated with a 5% higher risk (95% CI 5–6%) of developing T2DM [38].
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2025 ,22, 1275 9 of 13
Equally concerning is the impact of UPF consumption on the development of metabolic
syndrome, a condition associated with an increased risk of T2DM [ 40]. Recent evidence
from a study involving 8065 adults with a median UPF consumption of 360 g/day, followed
for an average of 7.9 years (SD 1.3), revealed that 31.1% (2508) of individuals developed
metabolic syndrome (MS). Through statistical modeling adjusted for TEI, socioeconomic
factors, and behavioral factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical activity,
it was observed that a 150 g/day increase in UPF consumption resulted in a 7% higher risk
(95% CI 1.05–1.08) of developing MS.
Similarly, when consumption was analyzed by quartiles, those corresponding to the
highest intakes, namely Q4 (between 366 g/day and 552 g/day) and Q4 (>552 g/day),
demonstrated a risk of 19% (95% CI 1.08–1.32) and 33% (95% CI 1.20–1.47), respectively, for
MS compared to the lowest consumption quartile [ 27]. These findings are consistent with
those of studies conducted in other populations, which have shown that higher UPF intake
is associated with a higher prevalence of MS, higher LDL-c levels, and elevated FG [41].
In relation to laboratory outcomes, we found that after adjusting for confounding
factors, levels of TC and LDL-c were associated with the highest quintiles of PF + UPF
consumption. When compared to the reference category, while the PF + UPF consumption
in Q3 and Q4 was associated with a similar increase of 26.6 mg/dL and 26.7 mg/dL,
respectively, in TC levels (Q3: 95% CI 10.7–42.6; Q4: 95% CI 10.69–42.69), consumption in
Q4 was associated with an increase of 19.8 mg/dL (95% CI 6.93–32.67) in LDL-c levels.
Thus far, the scientific literature examining the association between UPF intake and
lipid profile in individuals with T2DM remains limited. However, it has been previously
suggested that a consumption of at least 700 g/day of UPF seems to impact a reduction
of approximately 0.6 mg/dL in HDL-c ( p= 0.13) and a consistent increase of 2 mg/dL
in TG ( p= 0.26) [ 27]. Positively, our sample of individuals with T2DM, who were not
undergoing any nutritional monitoring, demonstrated a higher percentage of consumption
of minimally processed or unprocessed foods, which may have influenced the observed
lipid profile.
Possible limitations include the cross-sectional design itself, which does not account for
the temporality between exposure and outcome and is therefore subject to reverse causality
bias. Additionally, associations identified in cross-sectional studies do not imply causality.
Issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic, which necessitated adapting data collection to a
virtual mode, also represent potential limitations. However, this study focused on training
researchers who conducted the collections and tabulation to minimize potential errors, along
with verifying data quality to ensure reliable data reflecting reality. Due to the pandemic,
R24h were conducted on only two days, with one of the days being via telephone, which
warrants caution when interpreting the findings. Although R24h are among the most widely
used methods in epidemiological studies, their retrospective nature is a known limitation
that can lead to recall bias, a type of information bias [ 42]. Furthermore, this was a sub-study
developed from the NUGLIC study [ 18], a multicenter randomized clinical trial originally
designed to address a different research question. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that our
study was conducted across multiple outpatient centers, providing a representative sample.
5. Conclusions
In our sample of patients with T2DM, higher consumption of PF + UPF was associated
with higher levels of TC and LDL-c, which are important markers of cardiovascular risk. In
contrast, no associations were observed between PF + UPF consumption and FG, HbA1c,
BMI, or WC. These patients showed a lower daily energy intake from UPF compared to
previous studies, which suggests a need for caution when interpreting these results but
also highlights the importance of expanding strategies that promote the consumption of
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2025 ,22, 1275 10 of 13
and access to fresh or minimally processed foods. Future longitudinal studies are needed
to understand how the relationships between UPF consumption and metabolic parameters
are established in individuals with T2DM, filling the gaps that still exist in the scientific
literature. The cross-sectional nature of this study does not support any causal relationship.
