Impact of ultra‑processed foods 
consumption on the burden of obesity and type 
2 diabetes in Belgium: a comparative risk 
assessment

Abstract 
Background A high consumption of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) has been related to several chronic diseases such 
as obesity and type 2 diabetes. This study aimed to estimate the proportion of the burden of obesity and type 2 dia-
betes in Belgium that could be attributed to the consumption of UPFs.
Methods A comparative-risk assessment framework was used. A literature search and a dose-response meta-analysis 
between UPFs intake and obesity and type 2 diabetes were performed. The risks were extracted from the curve 
dose-response meta-analysis and extrapolated to the mean of UPFs consumption by strata (5-year age category/sex/
region) using the 2014/2015 Belgian Food Consumption Survey. The population attributable fraction and the attribut -
able burden were then calculated for the prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes, and disability-adjusted life-years 
(DALYs) for type 2 diabetes.
Results From the meta-analysis, for every 10% increase in UPFs intake (g/day), there was a 13% increase in risk 
of developing type 2 diabetes (RR:1.13, 95%IC 1.12-1.15, p<0.001) and for every 10% increase of energy intake 
from UPFs (kcal/day), there was a 5% increase in risk of developing obesity (RR:1.05, 95%IC 0.99-1.13, p=0.1321). Using 
these estimates, 21% of cases (277 056/1 286 454) of obesity in Belgium in 2014/2015 could be attributed to the UPFs 
intake. Similarly, for type 2 diabetes in Belgium in 2014/2015, 23% of cases (53 348/227 502) and 24% of DALYs (7 
998/34 034) were attributed to UPFs consumption.
Conclusions The sizeable impact of UPFs on the burden of obesity and type 2 diabetes in Belgium emphasizes 
the need to design and implement policies to address UPF consumption in Belgium.

Introduction
The food industry plays a central role in the production, 
preservation, manufacturing, distribution, marketing, 
and sale of food products [1]. Initially, food processing 
aimed to prevent spoilage and enhance food safety. How -
ever, over time, it has evolved to prioritize convenience, 
palatability, and affordability for consumers [2]. To better 
understand the impact of food processing on health, the 
NOVA classification was developed, categorizing foods 
based on their degree of processing rather than solely on 
nutrient composition or quality [1]. This system classi -
fies foods into four groups: (1) unprocessed or minimally 
processed foods, (2) processed culinary ingredients, (3) 
processed foods, and (4) ultra-processed foods (UPFs) 
[3]. The NOVA classification has become widely used in 
research investigating the links between food processing 
and health outcomes [4].
UPFs, which include ready-to-eat meals, sugar-sweet -
ened beverages, sweet biscuits, and artificially sweet -
ened products, constitute an increasing proportion of the 
global food supply [3]. These products are typically high 
in saturated fats, added sugars, and salt while being low 
in dietary fiber. Additionally, they are often energy-dense, 
nutritionally unbalanced, and lack essential micronu -
trients [1]. Numerous studies have demonstrated that a 
high intake of UPFs is associated with an increased risk of 
cardiometabolic diseases, including dyslipidemia, hyper -
tension, obesity, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), as 
well as cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases [5]. 
UPF consumption has also been linked to cancer, mental 
health disorders, and higher overall mortality [5, 6]. The 
mechanisms underlying these associations include the 
adverse nutritional profile of UPFs, the presence of food 
additives, emulsifiers, and artificial sweeteners, as well as 
potential metabolic and inflammatory effects [7].
Despite the accumulating evidence on the negative 
health impacts of UPFs, their consumption remains 
high worldwide. In low- and middle-income countries 
(LMICs), UPFs intake is rising rapidly [1]. The range 
across Europe of UPFs intake is between 12.2% and 40.8% 
of daily energy intake, with Belgium reporting an average 
consumption of 28.8% [8]. Another study estimates that 
36% of all food and beverages consumed by the Belgian 
population are classified as UPFs, accounting for approxi -
mately 50% of total daily energy intake [9].
Despite the growing concern regarding UPF consump -
tion, its contribution to the burden of disease has not 
yet been comprehensively estimated in large-scale stud -
ies. Quantifying this burden is essential to better under -
stand the magnitude of the public health challenge and 
to inform the development of targeted policies aimed at 
reducing UPF consumption. Regulatory measures, such 
as restricting the marketing of UPFs and limiting their availability and accessibility, could be instrumental in 
mitigating their impact.
This study aims to quantify the population attribut -
able fraction and attributable burden of UPF consump -
tion in obesity and T2DM among adults in Belgium using 
a comparative risk assessment. By providing country-
specific burden estimates, this research will contribute 
to the growing body of evidence on UPFs and support 
public health planning efforts to address their rising 
consumption.
Methods
This study is based on the Comparative Risk Assessment 
(CRA) methodology, in which the current level of expo -
sure is compared to a “counterfactual” or theoretical sce -
nario of lower consumption [10, 11]. The CRA provides 
a practical approach to estimating the burden of disease 
associated with an exposure in the absence of long-term 
longitudinal studies [8]. The counterfactual scenario, for -
mally referred to as the theoretical-minimum-risk expo -
sure level (TMREL), serves as the reference against which 
the current scenario is compared, providing an estimate 
of the additional risk experienced by the population due 
to the current exposure [11].
To gather all the necessary inputs for the CRA, several 
steps were taken. First, a literature review was conducted 
to assess the association between UPFs consumption 
and various health outcomes. Second, the dose-response 
relationship between UPFs —or energy intake from 
UPFs—and the development of obesity and T2DM was 
quantified using meta-analyses, as these were the out -
comes with sufficient evidence. Third, the proportion of 
the burden of obesity and T2DM attributable to UPFs 
consumption was calculated. Finally, the burden of obe -
sity and T2DM due to UPFs consumption in the Belgian 
population in 2014 was estimated.
Literature search
A literature search was conducted in Medline, Science -
Direct, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, and Google 
Scholar for studies published between January 2013 and 
September 2023. The search terms used were “Ultra-pro -
cessed food” and “Risk” . Studies were initially screened 
by title and abstract, followed by a full-text evaluation 
to determine eligibility. First, our review summarized 
all available evidence on UPFs consumption and chronic 
diseases. Then, we assessed the evidence and identified 
diseases with sufficient data to perform a dose-response 
meta-analysis, considering clinical relevance and the 
availability of data sources for Belgium (See Supplemen -
tary Table 1).

Eligibility criteria
The eligibility criteria followed the PICOS framework 
explained in Table  1. These criteria were based on the 
research question: What is the dose-response relation -
ship between ultra-processed food (UPF) consumption 
and the risk of chronic diseases (e.g., type 2 diabetes, 
obesity, cardiovascular disease, and cancer) in adults, 
based on prospective cohort studies? 
Chronic diseases considered in the literature search 
were those with available burden estimates, such as 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) or case counts. 
Children, adolescents, and pregnant women were 
excluded. The selection of the diseases included in 
the meta-analysis was based on the strength of the 
evidence and their clinical relevance. Of the health 
outcomes retrieved, only T2DM and obesity were 
identified as eligible for this study. One clinical trial 
assessed weight gain and glucose intolerance in 
healthy participants who followed either a diet high 
in UPFs or an unprocessed diet for 2 weeks [12]. Par -
ticipants on the UPFs diet exhibited significant weight 
gain and notable changes in appetite-related hor -
mones. However, due to the short trial period, glucose 
tolerance showed no significant differences. Regarding 
clinical relevance, obesity is a major risk factor for sev -
eral diseases, such as hypertension, T2DM, cancer, etc. 
[13]. Therefore, this study focused on the association 
between UPFs consumption and the risk of obesity 
(BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) and T2DM.
Critical appraisal of cohort studies
We performed a risk of bias assessment of the stud -
ies included in the dose-response meta-analysis using 
the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale adapted for cohort stud -
ies, which ranges from 0 to 9 points. Studies scoring 
≥7 were considered of good quality, those scoring 
between 4 and 6 were classified as fair quality, and 
those scoring <4 were considered of low quality [14].Comparative risk assessment model inputs
Exposure‑outcome function
A dose-response meta-analysis was conducted using 
a two-stage random-effects analysis in R version 4.3.2 
(package dosesresmeta). The analysis involved two 
stages: first, the regression coefficient for each study was 
retrieved; second, the total coefficient was calculated 
by aggregating the weighted averages of the individual 
study coefficients [15]. All studies reporting hazard ratios 
(HRs) assumed a proportional hazards model, where the 
HR was constant over the follow-up period. Linearity 
analysis was assessed using a restricted maximum likeli -
hood (REML) model, while non-linearity analysis was 
conducted using a restricted cubic spline with three 
knots (0.1, 0.5, 0.9) [16].
The measurement of UPFs consumption lacks stand -
ardization across studies and is reported in various 
units, e.g. g/day, kcal/day, or serving/day. Therefore, the 
units for UPFs consumption were determined based on 
their frequency in the cohort studies: For T2DM, UPFs 
consumption was calculated by dividing the daily UPFs 
intake (g/day) by total food intake (g/day). For obesity, 
UPFs consumption (%) was calculated by dividing the 
daily energy intake from UPFs (kcal) by total daily energy 
intake (kcal/day). Our meta-analysis evaluated UPF con -
sumption as a percentage of total food intake per day, 
expressed in g/day and kcal/day, depending on the units 
reported in cohort studies.
Ultra processed foods consumption
The 2014 Belgian Food Consumption Survey (FCS), a 
nationally representative study of 3 146 participants 
aged 3 to 64 years [17], was used to estimate current UPF 
intake in Belgium. For this study, only participants aged 
20 years and older were included to align with the meta-
analysis results [18].
The FCS 2014–2015 protocol and questionnaire are 
publicly available online [19]. Dietary intake was assessed 
using GloboDiet, a standardized computerized 24-hour 
dietary recall program, conducted on two non-consecu -
tive days [18].

Participants were stratified into 54 groups based on 
5-year age categories, sex, and region (Flanders, Brus -
sels-Capital, and Wallonia). Food items were classified 
according to the NOVA system, and the mean UPF con -
sumption for each stratum was weighted using popula -
tion sampling factors to ensure representativeness at the 
national level.
Burden estimates by diseases
Type 2 diabetes burden The Belgian National Burden 
of Disease Study (BeBOD) estimates the number of peo -
ple living with diabetes and corresponding DALYs strati -
fied by age, sex, and region. The BeBOD methodology is 
described in detail elsewhere [20].
Briefly, BeBOD defines diabetes mellitus using administra -
tive and electronic medical records, incorporating indi -
cators such as medication use, physician diagnosis, and 
hospital discharge data [20]. Diabetes cases and related 
DALYs are classified according to BeBOD guidelines, 
which define diabetes as “a group of metabolic diseases 
characterized by hyperglycemia resulting from defects 
in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. ” BeBOD also 
considers the diagnostic codes E10–E14, covering insu -
lin-dependent diabetes, non-insulin-dependent diabetes, 
malnutrition-related diabetes, other specific types of dia -
betes mellitus, and unspecified diabetes mellitus.
BeBOD accounts for patients with diabetes who experi -
ence disability or premature death due to complications. 
These include chronic conditions that require daily medi -
cation and may cause concern, as well as microvascular 
complications such as neuropathy and ophthalmopathy. 
However, macrovascular complications—including coro -
nary artery disease, stroke, and peripheral arterial dis -
ease—are classified separately under cardiovascular 
diseases [20].
Obesity burden  Two datasets were used to estimate 
the burden of obesity: (i) 2014 FCS data, which provided 
obesity prevalence by sex, region, and 5-year age cat -
egories. In the 2014 FCS, weight and height were objec -
tively measured [17]. (ii) STATBEL, the Belgian Statistical 
Office, which provides population data by region, 5-year 
age groups, and sex. The available 2014 STATBEL data 
were multiplied by the obesity prevalence from the 2014 
FCS to estimate the total number of obesity cases in Bel -
gium [21].
Comparative‑risk assessment model
Population attributable fractions (PAFs) represent the 
proportion of cases for a given outcome or risk factor that can be attributed to a specific level of exposure in a 
population [10].
PAFs can be calculated using different formulas, 
depending on the exposure-outcome relationship under 
study. In this study, exposure was assessed as average 
UPF consumption (g/day and kcal/day) by age group, sex, 
and region. A continuous version of the PAFs equation 
was applied [10]. The TMREL was defined as the level of 
UPF consumption associated with no risk, as determined 
by the density function [10].
Relative risks (RRs) for each exposure level were 
extracted from the dose-response meta-analysis curve 
and applied to age/sex/region-specific UPFs consump -
tion levels to calculate strata-specific PAFs. The attribut -
able burden (AB) was obtained by multiplying the PAF by 
the total number of DALYs or cases. The final aggregate 
analysis provided results for the entire Belgian popu -
lation, with the total rate (RT) expressed per 1 000 000 
inhabitants.
Policy scenarios
Two theoretical policy scenarios were evaluated for each 
disease: For T2DM, a reduction of 100 grams in total 
UPF consumption and a relative reduction of 10% in daily 
UPF intake.
For obesity, a reduction of 100 kcal in total energy from 
UPF intake and a relative reduction of 10% in daily UPF 
intake.
Results
Literature search
A total of 4 023 articles were identified after removing 
duplicates in the period 2013 −2023 (see Supplementary, 
Figure  1). From the literature search, 148 studies were 
evaluated in full text, 55 studies were included in the 
literature synthesis (see Supplementary, Table 2) and 93 
studies were excluded (see Supplementary, Table 3).
The units used to express UPF consumption varied 
across the literature, with grams per day being com -
monly employed in T2DM studies and percentages of 
daily caloric intake in obesity investigations. Due to 
limitations in data accessibility, unit conversion was not 
possible. Consequently, for T2DM and obesity, we used 
percentages of UPF consumption in g/day and kcal/day, 
respectively. As a result, six studies were excluded: two 
T2DM studies that assessed total UPF consumption in 
grams [22, 23] and three obesity studies that reported 
UPF intake in g/day or serving/day instead of kcal/day 
[24–26]. Additionally, a study examining comorbid 
depressive symptoms alongside UPF consumption in 
T2DM patients was excluded [27] as depressive status 
has been associated with an increased risk of T2DM 
[28]. Notably, after requesting additional data from the 
Page 5 of 16
 Gutierrez‑Ortiz et al. BMC Public Health         (2025) 25:1097 
 
authors, one study provided UPF consumption infor -
mation in the required units for our analysis across 
three distinct cohorts, allowing for its direct inclusion 
without the need for unit conversion [29]. Ultimately, 
three articles with a total of five cohorts on T2DM were 
included, while two out of four five studies were incor -
porated into the obesity analysis (Table 2 ).
In the T2DM meta-analysis, the five primary stud -
ies were UK Biobank, Nutrinet Santé, Nurses’ Health 
Study (NHS), Nurses’ Health Study II (NHSII), and the 
Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS). The last 
three studies were from the US.
Among the total 325 073 participants, 78% (254 191) 
were women. The follow-up duration was longer in 
the US cohort studies, ranging from an average of 26 
to 32 years, whereas the more recent UK and France 
cohorts had follow-up durations of 5.4 years and 6 
years, respectively. Food intake was assessed using 
FFQs (n =3) and repeated 24-hour recalls (n =2). T2DM 
diagnoses were self-reported and confirmed through a 
medical database (n =1), a validated algorithm (n =1), 
and a validated questionnaire (n =3).
In contrast, the obesity meta-analysis included two 
cohort studies: the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of 
Adult Health (ELSA) from Brazil and UK Biobank 
from the United Kingdom, with follow-up durations 
of 3.8 years and 5 years, respectively. There were 34 
486 participants, 55% (18 309) of whom were female. 
Food intake assessment was conducted using FFQs 
and repeated 24-hour recalls, while obesity diagnoses 
were based on baseline and follow-up body mass index 
(BMI) and annual weight measurements.
Dose‑response meta‑analysis
Type 2 diabetes
Our findings show a statistically significant linear 
dose-response association between UPF intake and 
an increased risk of T2DM. Specifically, for every 10% 
increase in UPF consumption in grams per day (g/day), 
the risk of T2DM increased by 13% (RR: 1.13, 95% CI: 
1.12–1.15, p < 0.001). The meta-analysis included five 
prospective cohort studies, with a total of 325 073 par -
ticipants. Heterogeneity was assessed using the  I2 sta-
tistic, which indicated no evidence of heterogeneity 
among the included studies  (I2 = 0%, p  = 0.785). The 
model fit was evaluated using the coefficient of deter -
mination (R2 = 0.924, Adjusted R2 = 0.920) (Figs.  1 
and 2). Additionally, a non-linear dose-response rela -
tionship was examined using restricted cubic splines, 
revealing significant evidence of a non-linear associa -
tion (p  < 0.001; p  for non-linearity < 0.001).Sensitivity analysis for T2DM Sensitivity analyses were 
conducted using a leave-one-out approach, excluding one 
study at a time. The results remained consistent with the 
primary analysis, with the estimated risk of T2DM rang -
ing from 13.4% to 13.8% for every 10% increase in UPF 
consumption. Notably, excluding the three US-based 
cohort studies resulted in a higher estimated risk of 16% 
per 10% increase in UPF consumption (RR: 1.16, 95% CI: 
1.07–1.25, p < 0.001).
Obesity
The dose-response meta-analysis for obesity indicated 
that each 10% increase in UPF consumption in kcal per 
day was associated with a 5% increased risk of obesity 
(RR: 1.05, 95% CI: 0.99–1.13, p = 0.1321,  I2 = 85.4%, p = 
0.008) (Figs. 3 and 4).
There was no evidence of a non-linear association (p = 
0.3025; p for non-linearity = 0.354). Due to the limited 
number of studies included in the analysis, a sensitivity 
analysis was not performed.
Critical appraisal with Newcastle‑Ottawa
Most studies (4 out of 5) were rated as good quality, with 
scores ranging from 0.7 to 0.8. In contrast, one study 
was rated as fair quality, with a score of 5. A detailed 
assessment can be found in the Supplementary Material, 
Table 4.
The ultra‑processed food consumption among adults 
in Belgium
A total of 1 155 adult participants were included in the 
study. Of these, 52% were female, 57% resided in the 
Flemish region, 35% in the Walloon region, and 8% in the 
Brussels-Capital region (Table 3).
The distribution of UPF consumption varied depend -
ing on the unit of measurement. When expressed as a 
percentage of total food weight (g/day %), the distribu -
tion was asymmetric, with a higher concentration of 
individuals consuming lower proportions of UPFs (see 
Supplementary, Figure 2). In contrast, when measured as 
a percentage of total energy intake (kcal/day %), the dis -
tribution appeared more symmetric, suggesting a more 
even spread across the population (see Supplementary, 
Figure 3). This difference likely arises because ultra-pro -
cessed foods tend to be more energy-dense than unpro -
cessed foods [1], meaning that a small proportion of total 
weight can contribute disproportionately to total energy 
intake.
Among sex and age categories, males aged 20 to 29 
years in the Flemish and Walloon regions had the high -
est consumption of UPFs compared to other age groups 
and females. Similarly, females aged 30 to 34 years in the

Walloon region had the highest UPF consumption among 
women. In contrast, the lowest UPFs was observed in 
females aged 60–64 years.Population attributable fraction and attributable burden
We extracted the RR from the dose-response meta-anal -
ysis and extrapolated it to the Belgian study population. 
The dose-response curves (Figs.  1 and 3) indicate that

zero UPF consumption is the only scenario with no asso -
ciated risk, meaning that the TMREL is zero.
In our analysis, the highest UPF consumption increased 
the risk of developing T2DM by 3.5 times compared to 
individuals with no UPF consumption (RR: 3.57, 95% CI: 
3.08–4.14). For obesity, the highest UPF consumption 
was associated with a 72% increased risk compared to 
individuals with no UPF consumption (RR: 1.72, 95% CI: 
1.16–2.55).
Following the calculation of PAFs and AB by categories, 
an aggregate analysis yielded results for the entire popu -
lation. In T2DM, our findings show that UPFs consump -
tion in Belgium was responsible for 23% of cases (53 348 
/227 502) and 24% of DALYs (7 998/34 034) of T2DM 
recorded in 2014. Also, the population rate of T2DM was 
8 250 cases per 1 000 000 habitants and 1 236 DALYs per 
1 000 000 habitants.
The proportion of T2DM cases and corresponding 
DALYs attributed to UPFs among regions was higher in 
Flanders with 25% of cases (26 267/ 106 289) and 25% 
DALYs (3 893/ 15 690), followed by 23% of cases (22 024/ 
97 588) and 23% DALYs (3 381/ 14 891) in Wallonia, 
and 21% of cases (5 057/23 626) and 21% DALYs (725/3 
452) in the Brussels-Capital Region. Between sexes, 26% 
of cases (31 690/124 130) and 25% of DALYs (5 039/19 
813) are attributed to UPFs in males, and 21% of cases (21 658/103 372) and 21% of DALYs (2 959/14 221) are 
attributed to UPFs in females. Regarding age categories, 
the group aged 20 to 24 years showed the highest pro -
portion of cases (918/2 866) and DALYs (97/303), with 
32% attributed to UPFs consumption for both cases and 
DALYs. As age increased in both sex groups, the propor -
tion of T2DM attributed to UPFs consumption decreased 
(Table 4).
On the other hand, 21% of cases (277 056/1 286 454) 
of obesity in Belgium in 2014 can be attributed to UPFs 
consumption. Here, the population rate was 4 175 per 1 
000 000 inhabitants. Among regions, the proportion of 
cases attributed to UPFs intake was higher in Flanders 
with 22% of cases (157 577/720 595) and in Wallonia with 
21% of cases (105 831/493 949), followed by the Brus -
sels-Capital Region with 19% of cases (13 648/71 910). 
Between sexes, 22% of cases (141 289/647 161) are attrib -
uted to UPF consumption in males and 21% of cases (135 
767/639 293) in females. Regarding age categories, the 
group aged between 20 to 24 years showed the highest 
proportion of cases (14 400/56 822) with 25% attributed 
to UPF consumption (Table 5).
In the two theoretical scenarios (see Supplementary 
Table 5 and Table 6), a hypothetical reduction of 100 
grams across all population strata could reduce 18% 
of cases and 20% of DALYs of T2DM from the total

estimated burden (44 282 cases and 6 645 DALYs), 
whereas a hypothetical reduction of 100 kcal across 
all population strata could reduce 19% of cases of obe -
sity from the total estimated burden (221 349 cases). 
On the other hand, in the hypothetical scenario with 
a 10% relative reduction in daily UPF intake, it could 
avert 14% of cases and 14% of DALYs of T2DM from 
the estimated burden (31 894 cases and 4 790 DALYs), 
and 17% of cases of obesity from the estimated burden 
(245 439 cases) (Figs. 5  and 6 ).
By subgroup analysis, the policy would benefit 
similar strata for each disease. For type 2 diabetes 
and obesity, males aged 20 to 29 years and residents 
of Flanders would benefit the most (Supplementary 
Table 5 and Table 6).Discussion
Our analysis provides a comprehensive estimation of 
the burden of obesity and T2DM attributable to UPF 
consumption in Belgium. We found that UPF intake 
was associated with a 13% increased risk of T2DM for 
every 10% increase in consumption. The burden esti -
mates suggest 8 250 cases per million inhabitants, cor -
responding to a proportional burden of 23%, and 1 236 
DALYs per million inhabitants, representing 24% of the 
total burden. For obesity, the meta-analysis indicated 
a 5% increased risk per 10% increase in UPF consump -
tion, though results were not statistically significant. The 
estimated burden for obesity was 4 175 cases per million 
inhabitants, accounting for 21% of total cases in Belgium 
in 2014.Table 4 Population attributable fraction and attributable burden of T2DM with 95%CI in the TMREL scenario

Our dose-response meta-analysis for T2DM aligns 
closely with a prior meta-analysis of seven cohort stud -
ies, which reported a RR of 1.12 (95% CI: 1.10–1.13) 
[29], and is somewhat comparable to another meta-
analysis that included five studies (four cohort and one cross-sectional), reporting an RR of 1.15 (95% CI: 1.06–
1.26) [34]. Three studies from these prior analyses were 
excluded due to differences in study design (cross-sec -
tional) [35], units of analysis (absolute amount) [22], or 
analytical approach (logistic regression) [36]. Regarding Table 5 Population attributable fraction and attributable burden of obesity with 95%CI in the TMREL scenario

confounding factors, all selected models were adjusted 
for age, sex, family history of T2DM, physical activity, 
baseline BMI, and total calorie intake. Additionally, three 
out of five included studies had follow-up periods rang -
ing from 26 to 32 years, but information on the time of 
diagnosis was lacking.
For obesity, the dose-response meta-analysis sug -
gested a 5% increased risk, but results were not signifi -
cant, and high heterogeneity was observed. This could be 
due to limited data in our analysis. Moreover, individuals 
with obesity may underreport calorie intake and exhibit 
impaired metabolic efficiency [37]. Additionally, the 
short follow-up periods (3.8 to 5 years) may have been 
insufficient, as sustained small dietary changes affect 
body weight over longer durations (e.g., 10 years) [37]. A 
previous meta-analysis found that a 10% increase in UPF 
consumption was associated with a 7% increased risk of 
obesity (HR 1.07, 95% CI: 1.03–1.11), based on five cross-
sectional and two cohort studies [38]. These last two 
cohort studies were included in our meta-analysis show -
ing slight similarity.
This study also explored two theoretical policy impact 
scenarios—absolute and relative reductions in UPF con -
sumption. Both scenarios demonstrated substantial 
decreases in burden estimates. However, no specific poli -
cies targeting UPF intake currently exist.Our study is the first to estimate the burden of T2DM 
attributable to UPF consumption, though prior research 
has linked UPFs to cardiovascular diseases and obesity 
[39, 40]. Globally, dietary risk factors contribute to 34.9% 
of T2DM-related DALYs, with the Global Burden of 
Disease (GBD) study identifying 11 dietary risk factors. 
Among these, processed meat consumption significantly 
contributes to T2DM burden [41]. In Belgium, processed 
meat was associated with a 36.1% proportional burden 
and a rate of 1 379 T2DM cases per million inhabitants 
in 2018. Some processed meats, such as sausages, fall into 
processed foods or UPFs [42]. Therefore, UPFs should be 
considered a global dietary risk for T2DM.
Regarding obesity, a study in Brazil attributed 28.6% 
of the increase in obesity prevalence over seven years 
to UPFs consumption [40]. Globally, 51.9% of T2DM-
related DALYs are attributed to high BMI, the primary 
risk factor among others, including dietary risks [43]. 
Given that UPFs partially contribute to obesity, their 
effect on T2DM should also consider mediation factors 
for a more accurate risk estimation [10].
Research has assessed the health risks of specific 
UPF subtypes (e.g., ready-to-eat meals, sweets, des -
serts, bread, cereals, yogurt) [3, 29]. Adding nutri -
tional information on individual UPFs could enhance 
the understanding of their health impacts. The NOVA 
Fig. 6 Estimated number of obesity cases under different UPF reduction scenarios in Belgium. This figure shows the total number of obesity 
cases expected under three scenarios: (1) a 10% reduction in UPF consumption (2) a reduction of 100 kcal per day from UPFs, and (3) TMREL 
(theoretical-minimum-risk exposure level). The differences between these scenarios highlight the potential number of cases that could be 
prevented with lower UPF intake

classification should complement ingredient declarations 
and nutritional quality scores, as recognizing the extent 
and purpose of food processing provides better insight 
into non-essential components.
Existing food policies primarily target specific com -
pounds, such as sugar taxation, front-of-package (FOP) 
labeling, marketing bans, sodium and trans-fat limits, 
and school food regulations [44]. Expanding these poli -
cies to encompass UPFs would require an expert-led 
operational definition of UPFs for regulatory purposes 
[45]. Although current policies have improved consump -
tion patterns, their long-term effects on chronic disease 
development require further study, as long-term moni -
toring is essential. The food industry often uses the “lack 
of effect” argument to oppose such policies [44].
Future studies should include participants with at least 
10 years of UPF exposure before a T2DM diagnosis to 
better assess causality, given that prediabetes—a revers -
ible stage—has an average duration of 10 years [46, 47]. 
Additionally, further research should assess social deter -
minants (e.g., income, education, food access, security) of 
UPF consumption, the economic and environmental bur -
den of UPFs, and policy impacts.
The limitations of our study are: First, our study is 
based on 2014 Food Consumption Survey (FCS) data, 
and UPF consumption may have increased since then 
[48]. However, a comparison with the 2004 survey 
showed no significant changes in UPF intake among indi -
viduals aged 15–64 years [49]. Second, while FFQ and 
24-hour recall are validated dietary assessment tools [50, 
51], they have inherent limitations, including recall bias, 
social desirability bias, and challenges in assessing long-
term dietary intake. These factors should be considered 
when interpreting dietary data in epidemiological stud -
ies [52]. Third, greater access to primary cohort data on 
obesity and its conversion into comparable units could 
improve our meta-analysis estimates.
The strengths of our study include a robust dose-
response meta-analysis, demonstrating consistency with 
previous research and supporting the extrapolation of 
relative risk estimates to UPF consumption levels. We are 
the first to estimate the contribution of UPF consump -
tion to the burden of obesity and T2DM in Belgium, 
offering stratified population data based on the Belgian 
Food Consumption Survey. Our findings underscore the 
need for UPF-related policies and provide a benchmark 
for comparison with the upcoming 2024 Food Consump -
tion Survey.
Conclusion
Our findings suggest that higher UPF consumption is 
associated with an increased risk of obesity and T2DM. 
In 2014, UPF intake was responsible for 23% of T2DM cases and 24% of related DALYs, as well as 21% of obe -
sity cases.
These burden estimates highlight the urgent need for 
policy interventions to limit UPF consumption. Despite 
ongoing debates on causality, the strong associations 
observed in longitudinal studies support the implemen -
tation of recommended public health policies to miti -
gate the impact of UPFs on chronic diseases.
